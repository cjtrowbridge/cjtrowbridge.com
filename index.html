                <p>I'm a senior at SFSU studying Urban Studies with a minor in Queer Ethnic Studies. I'm focusing on sustainable infrastructure for small-group communities.</p>
                <p>I'm working in sustainable infrastructure while also volunteering on disaster response and mutual aid around sustainable infrastructure. I also moonlight as an educator helping experimental and improvised communities develop sustainable infrastructure.</p>
                <p>I plan to expand this work after I graduate, helping more communities build the housing, food, and other infrastructure they need to survive and thrive in a changing world.</p>
                <p>My main long-term goal is to build an off-grid community which is focused on teaching people about sustainable infrastructure and other skills they will need in order to join sustainable off-grid communities or start one of their own.</p>

                <p>It will be part research institute, part hands-on learning, part community. Together we will work on R&D for sustainable alternative infrastructure, and on educating visitors and the public at large about these solutions.</p>
                <p>Anyone will be able to come and learn the fundamentals for each of the major categories of community infrastructure, free of charge.</p>

                <p>The era of covid has been a struggle. Initially we launched three projects and held public meetings to get them started, but because of the many overlapping disasters, we have been forced to refactor.</p>
                <p>We will be holding a public zoom session soon with more information about relaunching the projects and how you can plug in!</p>

                <p>I recently spent several weeks in the desolation wilderness (what an appropriate name) and I developed a manifesto combining intentional community, permaculture, and arcology with the goal of creating communities designed to survive and thrive during the ongoing collapse of the biosphere.</p>
                <p>The world is turning into a desert. Studies project that most of the US will be desert within the next few decades. I <a href="https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2020/09/15/desert-farming-is-better/">embrace the desert</a> and xericulture or agriculture designed for deserts. If the world is turning into a desert, then learning to embrace self-sufficience in the desert now will give communities an advantage during the difficult times on the horizon. I argue that there are actually <a href="https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2020/09/30/desert-advantages/">advantages</a> in terms of self-sufficiency for communities in the desert.</p>

                <p>Moving forward, I intend to buy hundreds of acres of land in the high desert to found such a community sometime in the next several years. Stay tuned for more info.</p>

              <p>As part of my tour of all the national parks this year, I'm visiting experimental communities around the country to document radically sustainable solutions to their infrastructure needs. I'm slowly working on getting all of these notes and photos and videos posted at <a href="https://nomadpedia.org">NomadPedia</a> and <a href="https://resource-sovereignty.net">Resource-Sovereignty</a></p>
              <p>I recently spent several days at the now infamous commune that went viral on TikTok. It's often wrongly called a cult. I can attest that it's just a normal communal farm. They are doing a really great job with radical sustainability and it was a joy to get to know them and ask lots of questions about their infrastructure solutions.</p>

              <p>While it's easy in America to find an endless stream of opinion presented as news and curated to reinforce whatever the algorithms think you already believe, it's hard to get actual objective news coverage today. When I say objective in this context I mean news that is being presented with an effort to avoid making political and ideological claims.</p>
              <p>I created this simple web app some years ago to try to bring together several excellent sources of news from around the world. It just shows a very short audio clip of the current events reported without politics or ideology from several reputable sources around the world.

              <div class="card-text">
                <p>During the Coronavirus pandemic, I found that a lot of people are suffering from the lethal threat of isolation. I have been kayaking for over twenty years, and generally go about once a week. I recently bought a new kayak and so I have an extra. This led me to invite others to kayak with me since kayaking is naturally a socially distant activity.</p>
                <p>When I posted pictures and video, many people asked to be invited. This inspired me to create a facebook group whith regular weekly events for people to attend.</p>
                <p><a class="btn btn-block btn-success" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/kayaksarequeer/" target="_blank">Join The Group!</a></p>
                <p><b>Note:</b> Unfortunately while these outdoor gatherings are safe amid coronavirus, they are not safe with smoke. Also many of the destinations are on fire. The fires put this project on hiatus and then winter came. I will work to revive this project come spring.</p>

              <div class="card-text">

                <p>I decided to perform a regression analysis and forecast based on the first six months of coronavirus data to see what it would say about the future. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/djcj88/posts/10163934112880722" target="_blank">The results were fairly terrifying</a>. The analysis shows that it will take four more years plus twenty-million deaths just in America before the pandemic ends, unless things change between now and then.</a>
                <p>This data inspired me to build a new tool which performs this regression analysis and forecast on a daily basis, with a moving projected end date and death toll.</p>
                <p>Stay tuned, this should be posted later this week.</p>
                <a href="https://cjtrowbridge.com/corona-projections/" target="_blank" class="mb-4 btn btn-block btn-success">Check Out Corona Projections</a>

                <p>I built a platform for tracking local numbers for coronavirus in your area. It allows you to see the numbers in your specific county plus the surrounding counties, all compared on a single graph.</p>
                <p>You can also view the same data for many other metropolitan areas.</p>
                <a href="https://cjtrowbridge.com/corona-country/" target="_blank" class="mb-4 btn btn-block btn-success">Check Out Carona Country</a>

                <p>I also built a platform for tracking the progress of the covid-19 pandemic around the world. It shows graphs for major metrics including both linear and logarithmic scaling. I also included sub pages for each country as breakouts. Details are included about how it fethces the data automatically every hour from the UN/ Johns Hopkins.</p>

                <p>I had asked several professors about which populations are the most impacted at Sierra College or which groups have the lowest success metrics compared to the average. I was surprised to learn that no one knew the answer so I decided to create a list of all populations which could be filtered and sorted by success.</p>

              <div class="card-text">
                <p>I wrote an honors project proposal in Spring of 2020 for a project that would use radio interferometry to listen to things like pulsars and quasars in order to triangulate their positions relative to the antenna array. This would basically work like a super high-precision GPS that would work anywhere in the universe without relying on GPS satellites.</p>
                <p>I also proposed to use the data to detect the propagation of gravity waves across the line of sight from the stars the array was listening to. This might be a much better way of detecting gravity waves than our current detector technology since it relies on observing a known stable transmission as it propagates across the interstellar medium.</p>
                <p>The project was shot down by the department because it was too complicated but NASA has since duplicated part of the work I proposed. They completed a pulsar-based GPS system, but have not yet published any research on using it to detect gravity waves.</p>
                <p>I later <a href="https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2020/12/02/diy-quasar-interferometry/">wrote at length</a> about my proposal and the future potential of radio interferometry. It's a topic I'm still very interested in and actively researching when I have time.</p>
                <p>There has been a lot of recent interest in phased antenna arrays since Elon Musk announced his Starlink internet service would use them in the residential reciever arrays.</p>

                <p>At least three white-nationalist neo-Nazi groups were active at Sierra College in 2019. They posted propaganda and recruitment flyers around campus on at least a dozen occasions. I worked on putting together a coalition between many student groups and outside groups to track and document this activity. I also built a blog for the strategic partnership to use as a central place to document and chronicle all the activity.</p>

                <p>I conducted an experiment to measure the effectiveness of simple diy methods for improving indoor air quality. This new project builds on earlier work done to <a href="https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2019/11/20/data-are-shiftpods-actually-cooler/" target="_blank">measure the effectiveness</a> of expensive Shiftpod tents versus cheap alternatives.</p>
                <p>As someone with severe asthma during a respiratory pandemic which overlaps with wildfire season, this is a particularly salient issue for me personally. I did some personal experiments with filtration methods last year which I built on with this new work. Check out my results!</p>
