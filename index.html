              <div class="card-text">
                <p>I'm a senior at SFSU studying Urban Studies with a minor in Queer Ethnic Studies. I'm focusing on sustainable infrastructure for small-group communities.</p>
                <p>I'm working in sustainable infrastructure while also volunteering on disaster response and mutual aid around sustainable infrastructure. I also moonlight as an educator helping experimental and improvised communities develop sustainable infrastructure.</p>
                <p>I plan to expand this work after I graduate, helping more communities build the housing, food, and other infrastructure they need to survive and thrive in a changing world.</p>
                <p>My main long-term goal is to build an off-grid community which is focused on teaching people about sustainable infrastructure and other skills they will need in order to join sustainable off-grid communities or start one of their own.</p>

                <p>It will be part research institute, part hands-on learning, part community. Together we will work on R&D for sustainable alternative infrastructure, and on educating visitors and the public at large about these solutions.</p>
                <p>Anyone will be able to come and learn the fundamentals for each of the major categories of community infrastructure, free of charge.</p>

                <p>I cofounded the first ever <a href="https://bwbsf.org/">SF Bay Area chapter of Burners Without Borders</a>! Ironically though the international network is headquartered here, they have not yet had an active chapter here.</p>
                <p>The era of covid has been a struggle. Initially we launched three projects and held public meetings to get them started, but because of the many overlapping disasters, we have been forced to refactor.</p>
                <p>We will be holding a public zoom session soon with more information about relaunching the projects and how you can plug in!</p>

                <p>Working at ClipperCreek, I learned about GRID Alternatives. GRID is a nonprofit providing solar power, electric vehicles, and charging infrastructure to people in marginalized groups. I was able to get an internship with GRID where I learned all about the state of the home solar power industry. Critically, I also learned about all the funding sources GRID uses to be able to provide all their infrastructure projects for cheap or for free for people who need them.</p>

                <p>I took a summer job at ClipperCreek between semesters. They design, build, and sell chargers for electric vehicles. They do all of this in one main building in California. This was an amazing opportunity to learn all about electric vehicle infrastructure, the state of the industry, and its place in the broader sociopolitical landscape.</p>
                <p>Working at ClipperCreek is also how I learned about GRID Alternatives, which is a nonprofit providing solar power, electric vehicles, and charging infrastructure to people in marginalized groups.</p>

              <p>As part of my tour of all the national parks this year, I'm visiting experimental communities around the country to document radically sustainable solutions to their infrastructure needs.

              <p>I recently spent several days at the now infamous commune that went viral on TikTok. It's often wrongly called a cult. I can attest that it's just a normal communal farm. They are doing a really great job with radical sustainability and it was a joy to get to know them and ask lots of questions about their infrastructure solutions.</p>

              <div class="card-text">
                <p>During the Coronavirus pandemic, I found that a lot of people are suffering from the lethal threat of isolation. I have been kayaking for over twenty years, and generally go about once a week. I recently bought a new kayak and so I have an extra. This led me to invite others to kayak with me since kayaking is naturally a socially distant activity.</p>
                <p>When I posted pictures and video, many people asked to be invited. This inspired me to create a facebook group whith regular weekly events for people to attend.</p>

              <div class="card-text">
                <p>I wrote an honors project proposal in Spring of 2020 for a project that would use radio interferometry to listen to things like pulsars and quasars in order to triangulate their positions relative to the antenna array. This would basically work like a super high-precision GPS that would work anywhere in the universe without relying on GPS satellites.</p>
                <p>I also proposed to use the data to detect the propagation of gravity waves across the line of sight from the stars the array was listening to. This might be a much better way of detecting gravity waves than our current detector technology since it relies on observing a known stable transmission as it propagates across the interstellar medium.</p>
                <p>The project was shot down by the department because it was too complicated but NASA has since duplicated part of the work I proposed. They completed a pulsar-based GPS system, but have not yet published any research on using it to detect gravity waves.</p>
                <p>I later <a href="https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2020/12/02/diy-quasar-interferometry/">wrote at length</a> about my proposal and the future potential of radio interferometry. It's a topic I'm still very interested in and actively researching when I have time.</p>
                <p>There has been a lot of recent interest in phased antenna arrays since Elon Musk announced his Starlink internet service would use them in the residential reciever arrays.</p>

                <p>At least three white-nationalist neo-Nazi groups were active at Sierra College in 2019. They posted propaganda and recruitment flyers around campus on at least a dozen occasions.

I also built a blog for the strategic partnership to use as a central place to document and chronicle all the activity.</p>

            <div class="card-text">
              <p>While it's easy in America to find an endless stream of opinion presented as news and curated to reinforce whatever the algorithms think you already believe, it's hard to get actual objective news coverage today. When I say objective in this context I mean news that is being presented with an effort to avoid making political and ideological claims.</p>
              <p>I created this simple web app some years ago to try to bring together several excellent sources of news from around the world. It just shows a very short audio clip of the current events reported without politics or ideology from several reputable sources around the world. It makes it very easy to click onto the page and get a quick update.</p>

              <div class="card-text">
                <p>I conducted an experiment to measure the effectiveness of simple diy methods for improving indoor air quality. This new project builds on earlier work done to <a href="https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2019/11/20/data-are-shiftpods-actually-cooler/" target="_blank">measure the effectiveness</a> of expensive Shiftpod tents versus cheap alternatives.</p>
                <p>As someone with severe asthma during a respiratory pandemic which overlaps with wildfire season, this is a particularly salient issue for me personally. I did some personal experiments with filtration methods last year which I built on with this new work. Check out my results!</p>

              <div class="card-text">
                <p>One of my greatest long-term aspirations is to open a venture capital firm dedicated to ethics, justice, and sustainability. I like the phrase "Community Capital" which seems to convey these points while also conveying a dedication to both crowd funding and crowd sourcing.</p>
                <p>There are many examples of socially conscious VC funds, but none that I know of is also focused on sustainability. There is a new perspective developing at the intersection of business and sociology which argues that sustainable and ethical business practices are better investments.</p>
                <p>In the case of the Vanguard ESGV ETF, their portfolio focuses on companies which value best practices in environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG). This is a good example where the argument ESG is making is that these ESG-conscious companies will outperform other companies.</p>
                <p>I plan to eventually start a VC firm which focuses on ESG investments and helps companies develop into better ESG citizens. Putting out information about this topic will also be an excellent way to lead social change while drawing in further investment.</p>

              <div class="card-text">
                <p>About a decade ago, I opened a cafe in Chico, CA. It's still there today though I am no longer involved as I moved away for school. I have had a great deal of time to reflect on my challenges and successes in that project, and to compare my work to other cafes around the world. I plan to open a new cafe in the bay area which focuses primarily on RTD&E price-accessibility and providing food for a diverse array of cultural needs.</p>
